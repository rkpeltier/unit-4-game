# Crystal Collector or Unit 4 Game

Game built utilizing Jquery. 

Computer randomly generates a number, user has to click on any of the four crystals which will add their own number value to a different div. The goal is to guess exactly up to the number of the computer guess in order to win the game. If the user goes over it, they lose. If the user either wins or loses, the computer generates a new number. The crystals also generate new numbers each game.

Math.floor method is used to generated the times and tied to on click events.
